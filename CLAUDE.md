# WayCore Bank Scraper — Claude Code Context

## What This Is
CLI-driven bank scraper. Logs into a bank portal via browser automation, extracts accounts,
transactions, and balances, stores them in Postgres. Durable workflow via Restate handles
crash recovery and OTP pause/resume. LLM (Claude vision) handles DOM understanding.

## Architecture (short version)
```
CLI (typer) → Restate (durable workflow) → Worker (Playwright + Claude vision) → PostgreSQL
```

## Three Layers (Always All Three)
- **Layer 1 — Execution**: Playwright + stealth always runs. Drives the browser. Has no opinion.
- **Layer 2 — Intelligence**: LLM (multiple focused calls per goal). Observes DOM/screenshot, returns JSON action. Provider: Anthropic API, lazy-initialized in `extractor.py`.
- **Layer 3 — Orchestration**: Adapter sequences goals. `HeritageBankAdapter` passes selector hints. `GenericAdapter` lets LLM discover everything. Both use same execution + intelligence layers.

## Key Design Rules
1. Every bank is a `BankAdapter` subclass in `src/adapters/`. Never put bank logic elsewhere.
2. LLM calls are per-goal and focused (not one big prompt). Each call has a task-specific system prompt and returns structured JSON.
3. Sync jobs must write `sync_steps` records for every step — this is the audit trail and human debugging surface.
4. On any failure: save screenshot, write error to step output, set step+job status. Never swallow errors silently.
5. Credentials: always encrypt (Fernet) before DB write. Decrypt only inside worker memory. Never log.
6. Transactions: `ON CONFLICT (account_id, external_id) DO NOTHING` — all writes idempotent. Batch inserts.
7. Balances: append-only. Never UPDATE balance rows.

## Stack
- Python 3.12, `uv`
- Restate (`restate-sdk`) — durable workflows, OTP human-in-loop via `ctx.promise`
- Playwright async + `playwright-stealth` — stealth browser, bezier mouse movement
- SQLAlchemy 2.x async + Alembic — ORM + migrations
- PostgreSQL 16 (Docker Compose for local dev)
- Claude claude-sonnet-4-6 vision — LLM DOM extraction in `GenericAdapter`
- structlog — JSON logs, always bind job_id
- typer + rich — CLI with live step trace

## Local Dev
```bash
docker compose up -d        # postgres + restate + worker + register
uv run alembic upgrade head # run migrations
uv run waycore sync --bank-url URL --username U --password P --otp CODE
```

## Adding a New Bank (structured adapter)
1. `src/adapters/<bank_slug>.py` implementing `BankAdapter`
2. Register in `ADAPTER_REGISTRY` in `src/adapters/__init__.py`

## Development Workflow

After every meaningful chunk of code written, run:
- `/review` — principal engineer review: bugs, wrong assumptions, dead code, CLAUDE.md violations
- `/style` — style consistency check: type hints, logging, naming, imports

Run both before considering any feature done. Fix MUST FIX items immediately.
To run on a loop during a session: `/loop 20m /review`
